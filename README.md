## Features
- Perform numerical computations like prime checks and GCD/LCM calculations.
- Handle string manipulations, including trimming, reversing, and conversions.
- Work with arrays for sorting, searching, and transformations.
- Perform matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition.
- Use encryption ciphers like Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and basic XOR encryption.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/c-mylib-library.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd c-mylib-library
   ```
3. Include the library in your C project by adding the `mylib.h` and `mylib.c` files to your project.

## Usage
Include the library in your code:
```c
#include "mylib.h"

int main() {
    int gcd = find_gcd(48, 18);
    printf("GCD: %d\n", gcd);

    char encrypted[50];
    caesar_cipher("hello", encrypted, 3);
    printf("Encrypted: %s\n", encrypted);

    return 0;
}
```

Compile your program with the library:
```bash
gcc main.c mylib.c -o program
```
