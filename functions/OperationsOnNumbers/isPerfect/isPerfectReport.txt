### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Perfect Number Checker  
**Purpose**: This program checks if a given number is a perfect number (a number whose divisors, excluding itself, sum to the number).

---

### **Features**  
1. Checks whether a given integer (`num`) is a perfect number.  
2. Computes the sum of divisors of `num` (excluding `num` itself) and compares it to the original number.  
3. Returns `true` if the number is perfect, and `false` otherwise.

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - A single integer (`num`), assumed to be positive.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns `true` if the number is perfect (i.e., if the sum of its divisors equals the number).  
   - Returns `false` if the number is not perfect.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Initialize the sum (`S`) to 1, as `1` is a divisor of all numbers.  
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate from `2` to `num / 2` to find all divisors of the number.  
3. For each divisor `i` where `num % i == 0`, add `i` to the sum (`S`).  
4. After completing the loop, check if the sum of divisors (`S`) equals the original number (`num`).  
5. Return `true` if they are equal, indicating that the number is perfect; otherwise, return `false`.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Correctly identifies perfect numbers by calculating the sum of divisors.  
   - Efficient for smaller numbers, as it checks divisibility up to `num / 2`.

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Assumes a positive integer input and does not handle invalid or negative numbers.  
   - Performance may degrade for large numbers due to the need to check divisibility up to `num / 2`.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - `<stdbool.h>` for the `bool` data type and `true`/`false` values.
