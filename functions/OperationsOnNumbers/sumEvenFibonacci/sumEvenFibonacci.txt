### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers  
**Purpose**: This program calculates the sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to a given number (`n`). It iterates through Fibonacci numbers and adds the even ones to the total sum.

---

### **Features**  
1. Computes Fibonacci numbers iteratively.  
2. Filters out odd Fibonacci numbers and sums up only the even ones.  
3. Returns the total sum of the even Fibonacci numbers up to the specified number (`n`).

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - An integer `n`, representing the limit for generating Fibonacci numbers.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns an integer, which is the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Initialize `S` to store the sum of even Fibonacci numbers.  
2. Use a `for` loop to generate Fibonacci numbers up to `n` with increments of 3 (to only consider every third Fibonacci number).  
3. For each Fibonacci number, calculate it iteratively by starting with `F1 = 1` and `F2 = 0`, then iteratively computing the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.  
4. If the Fibonacci number is even, add it to the sum `S`.  
5. Return the sum `S` once all relevant Fibonacci numbers are processed.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Efficiently computes and sums even Fibonacci numbers up to the specified number.  
   - The program ensures that only even Fibonacci numbers are added, avoiding unnecessary calculations.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - No external libraries used; simple iterative Fibonacci calculation.
