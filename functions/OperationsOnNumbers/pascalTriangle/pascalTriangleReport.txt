### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Pascal’s Triangle Generator  
**Purpose**: This program generates and prints Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows (`n`). Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients.

---

### **Features**  
1. Prints Pascal’s Triangle in a visually structured and centered format.  
2. Calculates binomial coefficients iteratively to avoid calculating large factorials.  
3. Dynamically adjusts the triangle for any number of rows (`n`).

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - An integer `n`, representing the number of rows in Pascal’s Triangle.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - A formatted display of Pascal’s Triangle with `n` rows printed to the console.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Use a nested loop structure:  
   - The outer loop iterates through rows from `0` to `n-1`.  
   - The inner loop calculates and prints the coefficients for each row.  
2. Center each row by printing spaces proportional to the row's position in the triangle.  
3. Compute binomial coefficients dynamically:  
   - Start with `c = 1` for each row.  
   - Update `c` iteratively using the formula: Ci.j = Ci.j-1 * (i-j+1)/j
4. Print each coefficient, separated by spaces.  
5. Move to the next row after completing the current row.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Dynamically calculates coefficients without requiring precomputed values.  
   - Avoids large factorial calculations through iterative computation of coefficients.  
   - Neatly formatted output, centered for visual clarity.  

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Limited by the range of the `unsigned long` type; large values of `n` may cause overflow.  
   - Assumes non-negative integer input for `n`.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - Standard I/O functions from `<stdio.h>` for console output.  
3. **Approach**:  
   - Iterative computation of binomial coefficients for efficiency.  
   - Simple formatting to create a triangular structure.
