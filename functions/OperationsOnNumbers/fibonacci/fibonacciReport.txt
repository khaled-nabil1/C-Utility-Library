### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Fibonacci Sequence Generator  
**Purpose**: This program generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`-th term.

---

### **Features**  
1. Computes the Fibonacci sequence for the specified number of terms (`n`).  
2. Prints each Fibonacci number up to the `n`-th term.  
3. Handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, ensuring correct output for smaller sequences.

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - A single integer (`n`), which specifies the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Prints the Fibonacci sequence from the first term up to the `n`-th term.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Check if `n` is at least 1 and print the first Fibonacci number (`0`).  
2. If `n` is at least 2, print the second Fibonacci number (`1`).  
3. Use a `for` loop starting from the third term to generate and print each Fibonacci number up to the `n`-th term:  
   - Calculate the next Fibonacci number `F` as the sum of `F1` and `F2`.  
   - Print the Fibonacci number and update `F1` and `F2` to the previous two numbers.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Efficient and simple method to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence.  
   - Handles edge cases for small values of `n`.  
2. **Limitations**:  
   - Assumes the input `n` is positive; does not handle cases where `n <= 0`.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - `<stdio.h>` for the `printf` function to display the Fibonacci numbers.
