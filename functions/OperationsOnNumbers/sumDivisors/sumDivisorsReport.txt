### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Sum of Divisors Calculator  
**Purpose**: This program calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number (excluding the number itself).

---

### **Features**  
1. Computes the sum of all divisors of an integer (`num`) excluding the number itself.  
2. Iterates from `2` to `num/2` to find all divisors and adds them to a running total.  
3. Returns the sum of divisors as an integer.

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - A single integer (`num`), assumed to be positive.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns the sum of divisors of the input number excluding the number itself.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Initialize the sum (`S`) to 1, as `1` is a divisor of all numbers.  
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate from `2` to `num / 2` to find all divisors of the number.  
3. For each divisor `i` where `num % i == 0`, add `i` to the sum (`S`).  
4. Return the final sum of divisors.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Correctly identifies and sums all divisors of the number excluding the number itself.  
   - Efficient for smaller numbers, as the loop only iterates up to `num / 2`.

2. **Limitations**:  
   - The program assumes a positive integer input and does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer or negative values).  
   - The performance may degrade for very large numbers, as it checks divisibility up to `num / 2`.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**: None; relies on standard control structures and arithmetic operations.
