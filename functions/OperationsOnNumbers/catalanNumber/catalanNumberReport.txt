### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Catalan Number Calculator  
**Purpose**: This program calculates the nth Catalan number. Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that appear in various combinatorial problems, such as counting binary trees, parenthetical expressions, and more.

### **Features**  
1. Computes the nth Catalan number using a closed-form formula.  
2. Efficient calculation using iterative multiplication and division to avoid overflow.  
3. Returns the Catalan number as an unsigned long integer.

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - An integer `n` representing the desired position in the Catalan sequence.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns the nth Catalan number as an unsigned long integer.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Check if `n` is `0` or `1`. If true, return `1` directly, as the first two Catalan numbers are `1`.  
2. Initialize a variable `catalan` to `1`.  
3. Use a `for` loop to iteratively calculate the Catalan number using the formula:  Cn = (2n)!/(n+1)!*n!
   Simplify the computation by iteratively multiplying and dividing terms to avoid factorial calculations.  
4. Return the computed Catalan number.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Efficient computation without calculating full factorials.  
   - Handles relatively large values of `n` due to careful handling of overflow in intermediate calculations.  

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Only supports non-negative integer inputs.  
   - The range of `n` is limited by the size of the `unsigned long` type, which may overflow for large values of `n`.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - No external libraries used. Basic iterative arithmetic implemented for efficiency.
