### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Sum of Digits Calculator  
**Purpose**: This program calculates the sum of the digits of an integer.

---

### **Features**  
- Computes the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer.
- Handles integers of varying lengths efficiently.

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
- **Inputs**:  
  - A single integer (`num`) as input.  
  - Assumes `num` is non-negative.

- **Outputs**:  
  - An integer representing the sum of the digits of the input number.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Initialize a variable (`S`) to store the sum of digits.  
2. Repeat the following steps while the input number (`num`) is greater than 0:  
   - Extract the last digit of the number using the modulo operator (`num % 10`).  
   - Add the extracted digit to the sum (`S`).  
   - Remove the last digit of the number by dividing it by 10 (`num = num / 10`).  
3. Once the number becomes 0, return the calculated sum (`S`).

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Efficiently calculates the sum of digits using a simple loop.  
  - Works for any non-negative integer input.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs.
