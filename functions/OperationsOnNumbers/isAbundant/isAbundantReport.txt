### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Abundant Number Checker  
**Purpose**: This program checks if a given number (`num`) is an abundant number. An abundant number is one where the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) is greater than the number.

---

### **Features**  
1. Computes the sum of proper divisors of a number.  
2. Determines if the sum of proper divisors is greater than the original number, making it an abundant number.  
3. Returns `true` if the number is abundant and `false` otherwise.

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - A single integer (`num`), assumed to be a positive integer.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns `true` if the number is abundant (i.e., the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number).  
   - Returns `false` if the number is not abundant.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Initialize a variable `S` to `1` to store the sum of proper divisors of `num`.  
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through potential divisors from `2` to `num / 2`. For each divisor, if it divides `num` without a remainder, add it to `S`.  
3. After the loop, check if the sum of divisors (`S`) is greater than `num`.  
4. Return `true` if the sum is greater, indicating the number is abundant; otherwise, return `false`.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Correctly identifies abundant numbers by comparing the sum of their proper divisors to the number itself.  
   - Simple and easy to understand logic.

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Assumes the input `num` is positive. Negative numbers are not handled.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - `<stdbool.h>` for the `bool` data type and `true`/`false` values.
