### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Palindrome Checker  
**Purpose**: This program checks whether a given integer is a palindrome.

---

### **Features**  
- Determines if an integer reads the same forwards and backwards.
- Uses an efficient approach to reverse the number and compare it with the original.

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
- **Inputs**:  
  - A single integer (`num`) as input.  
  - Assumes `num` is non-negative.

- **Outputs**:  
  - Returns `true` if the number is a palindrome.  
  - Returns `false` if the number is not a palindrome.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Store the original number (`n`) in a temporary variable for later comparison.  
2. Initialize a variable (`R`) to store the reversed number and set it to 0.  
3. Repeat the following steps while the input number (`num`) is greater than 0:  
   - Extract the last digit of the number using the modulo operator (`num % 10`).  
   - Append the extracted digit to the reversed number by updating `R = R * 10 + digit`.  
   - Remove the last digit of the number by dividing it by 10 (`num = num / 10`).  
4. Compare the reversed number (`R`) with the original number (`n`).  
5. Return `true` if they are equal, indicating the number is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Efficiently checks for palindromes using a straightforward algorithm.  
  - Works well for any non-negative integer input.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs.  
  - Assumes the input fits within the standard integer range.

### **Code Summary**  
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
  - `<stdbool.h>` for the `bool` data type and `true`/`false` values.  
  - Relies on standard arithmetic operations for reversing the number.
