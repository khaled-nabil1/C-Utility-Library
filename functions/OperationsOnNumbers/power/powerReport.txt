### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Power Function  
**Purpose**: This program calculates the result of raising a base number (`base`) to an exponent (`exp`), handling both positive and negative exponents.

---

### **Features**  
1. Computes the power of a number by multiplying the base by itself for the number of times indicated by the exponent.  
2. Handles positive, zero, and negative exponents.  
3. Returns the result as a `double` value.

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - An integer `base`, representing the base number.  
   - An integer `exp`, representing the exponent to which the base is raised.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns a `double` value, which is the result of `base` raised to the power of `exp`.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. If the exponent (`exp`) is `0`, return `1` as any number raised to the power of zero equals one.  
2. If the exponent is negative, convert the base to its reciprocal (`1/base`) and make the exponent positive.  
3. Initialize `result` to `1`.  
4. Use a `for` loop to multiply `result` by the base, `exp` number of times (i.e., perform repeated multiplication).  
5. Return the final result after all iterations.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Correctly handles both positive and negative exponents.  
   - Simple and intuitive approach for calculating powers.

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Assumes valid inputs (e.g., the base is a valid number and exponent is an integer).  
   - The program may not handle extremely large exponents efficiently, as it performs each multiplication sequentially.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - No external libraries used; basic arithmetic operations and a loop are employed for computation.
