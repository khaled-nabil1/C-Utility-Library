### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Factorial Calculator  
**Purpose**: This program computes the factorial of a non-negative integer.

---

### **Features**  
- Calculates the factorial of an integer (`num`) efficiently using an iterative approach.  
- Handles large factorial values by storing the result in a `long` data type.

---

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
- **Inputs**:  
  - A single integer (`num`), assumed to be non-negative.

- **Outputs**:  
  - Returns the factorial of the input number as a `long` integer.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Initialize a variable (`f`) to 1 to store the factorial result.  
2. Use a `while` loop that runs while `num` is greater than 0:  
   - Multiply `f` by the current value of `num`.  
   - Decrement `num` by 1.  
3. Once `num` reaches 0, return the computed factorial stored in `f`.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Simple and efficient iterative approach to calculate the factorial.  
  - Can handle moderately large factorials due to the use of the `long` data type.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - The program does not handle negative numbers, as the factorial is only defined for non-negative integers.  
  - May overflow for very large numbers since `long` has a limit on its size depending on the platform.

### **Code Summary**  
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **Tools or Libraries Used**: None; relies on standard arithmetic operations and control structures.
