### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Smith Number Checker  
**Purpose**: This program checks if a given number is a Smith number. A Smith number is a composite number whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of digits of its prime factors (excluding the number itself).

---

### **Features**  
1. Identifies Smith numbers by verifying if the sum of digits of the number matches the sum of digits of its prime factors.  
2. Efficiently checks if a number is prime before proceeding to factorization.  
3. Utilizes helper functions to calculate the sum of digits and prime factorization.

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - An integer `num`, the number to be checked.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns `true` if the number is a Smith number, and `false` otherwise.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. Check if `num` is less than 2, as these cannot be Smith numbers.  
2. Check if the number is prime using a simple primality test. If it is prime, return `false` because prime numbers cannot be Smith numbers.  
3. Initialize a variable `S` to store the sum of the digits of the prime factors.  
4. Factorize `num` by dividing it by integers starting from 2, and for each prime factor, add the sum of its digits to `S`.  
5. If `num_copy` (the remaining part of `num`) is greater than 1, it is a prime factor, and its digit sum should also be added to `S`.  
6. Compare the sum of digits of `num` with `S`.  
   - If they are equal, return `true` (the number is a Smith number).  
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Efficient primality check before factorization, which reduces unnecessary computations.  
   - Proper handling of composite numbers, ensuring only relevant numbers are processed.  
   - Easy-to-follow logic and structure.  

2. **Limitations**:  
   - The prime factorization loop could become slow for very large numbers due to the check for all integers up to `num/2`.  
   - The approach assumes integer input, which may be limited by the size of the `int` data type in C.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - Standard arithmetic operations and loops.  
   - Boolean type from `<stdbool.h>` for return values.  
3. **Approach**:  
   - Combines primality testing with digit sum comparison and prime factorization to identify Smith numbers.
