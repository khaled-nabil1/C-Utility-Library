### **Title and Overview**  
**Program Name**: Bell Number Calculator  
**Purpose**: This program computes the nth Bell number, which represents the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into non-empty subsets.

---

### **Features**  
1. Recursively calculates Bell numbers using a combinatorial approach.  
2. Utilizes binomial coefficients to determine the contribution of smaller partitions.  
3. Returns the computed Bell number as an unsigned long long integer.

### **Inputs and Outputs**  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - An integer `n`, representing the position in the Bell number sequence.  
2. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns the nth Bell number as an unsigned long long integer.

---

### **Workflow**  
1. If `n` is `0`, return `1`, as the 0th Bell number is defined as `1`.  
2. Initialize a variable `bell` to `0` to store the computed Bell number.  
3. Use a loop to sum the contributions of all partitions, given by the formula:  
   \[
   B_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{i} \cdot B_i
   \]  
4. For each term in the sum:  
   - Compute the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n-1}{i}\) using a helper function `binomialCoefficient`.  
   - Recursively calculate the Bell number for smaller values `B_i`.  
5. Return the computed value of `bell`.

### **Strengths and Limitations**  
1. **Strengths**:  
   - Recursive implementation closely follows the mathematical definition of Bell numbers.  
   - Provides accurate results for small values of `n`.  

2. **Limitations**:  
   - The recursive approach can be computationally expensive for large values of `n`.  
   - The range is limited by the size of the `unsigned long long` type.

### **Code Summary**  
1. **Programming Language**: C  
2. **Tools or Libraries Used**:  
   - Standard data types and arithmetic operations.  
3. **Dependencies**:  
   - Requires a `binomialCoefficient` function to calculate binomial coefficients efficiently.
